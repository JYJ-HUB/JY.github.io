						<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
							Fiber reinforced composite materials have excellent physical properties such as non-strength and have lower heat transfer and thermal expansion factors compared to metals, which are actively applied in many industries such as sports goods, automobiles, aviation, and bio. In particular, for use in areas requiring thermal performance, it is necessary to model the thermal properties of the final composite material in advance for optimal design. However, due to the complex and heterogeneous heat transfer behavior, conventional numerical methods are difficult to calculate. In the previous study, textile-type fiber-reinforced composite materials were composed of voxel, and a system was constructed to predict heat transfer behavior by applying FDM method. In this study, we want to test the numerical stability and performance of carbon composite heat transfer simulations using the particle method, a semi-implicit integration method known to use larger time steps.<br />

                                3D printing, including FDM methods, has been relatively time-consuming and cost-effective, but has the disadvantage of having a long output time and unnecessary support structure. Also, because the size of the output is limited by the size of the printer, larger objects must be pre-partitioned. In addition, clothing design is distinguished by human characteristic points, but no previous work has been conducted on such split-output techniques. Therefore, in this work, large mannequin data of real-world human size are automatically split and 3D printed using bounding boxes based on human characteristics considering printer size. After splitting the mannequin into v-cut and pie-cut, we will organize the output data on three scales: 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8, and compare them with theoretical values to analyze the amount of support.<br />
