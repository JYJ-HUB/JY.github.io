						/ KFS /<br />
								<br />
					<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
						In this study, a new 3D-printing technology was used to generate 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 scale manikins. The pose of the manikin was assumed to be A-shaped, which is the reference for 3D body scanning. Before printing, manikin mesh data was automatically disassembled into 6 parts and each part was partitioned into multiple segments in vertical and horizontal directions to fit the maximum printing volume. A 3D bounding box with simple geometry was used to control the segmentation size and direction. The bounding box could have equal vertical intervals or could be set arbitrarily by specifying body-feature point location. The final segments were exported and converted to g-code files for 3D printing and the amount of support structures in these three scales and two slicing directions were compared.<br />
